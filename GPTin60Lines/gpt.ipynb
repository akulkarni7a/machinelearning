    "General Terms:\n",
    "1. Greedy Sampling - picking the highest probability as our prediction \n",
    "2. Autoregressive - process of predicting a future value (regression) and adding it back into the input (auto) = autogressive\n",
    "3. Stochasticity (Randomness) - we can add randomness by sampling from the probability distribution instead of being random. This allows us to generate different sentences given the same input. When combined with techniques like top-k, top-p, and temperature, which modify the distribution prior to sampling, the quality of our outputs is greatly increased.\n",
    "4. Top K - [sample](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/controlling-generation-with-top-k-top-p#2-pick-from-amongst-the-top-tokens-top-k) from a shortlist of k tokens. Top-k of 1 is greedy\n",
    "5. [Top P](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/controlling-generation-with-top-k-top-p#3-pick-from-amongst-the-top-tokens-whose-probabilities-add-up-to-15-top-p) - creates the shortlist by selecting the top tokens whose sum of likelihoods does not exceed a certain value\n"
