I first split by words because I wanted to generate a sentence. But then I struggled with not beint entirely sure how to put stop and end tokens. 

But it was a bit challenging to figure out how to label stop and start - so I'm splitting by paragraph. 

But! it can't be paragraph because every paragraph is a new item in the vocabulary - there's zero overlap
